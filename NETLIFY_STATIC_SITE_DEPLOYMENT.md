# Netlify Static Site Deployment

This guide describes how to deploy `babylon-game-starter` as a static site to Netlify, and how to configure the multiplayer behavior for the published client.

## Overview

Netlify static deployment is a front-end-only build. No backend multiplayer service is hosted on Netlify itself.

For multiplayer, the client must connect to a remote multiplayer server or run with multiplayer disabled.

## Supported multiplayer modes

1. **NONE**
   - Disable multiplayer entirely.
   - Use this when you want the game to run as a fully local single-player scene.
   - Configure in `src/client/config/game_config.ts`:
     ```ts
     MULTIPLAYER: {
       ENABLED: false,
       PRODUCTION_SERVER: 'bgs-mp.onrender.com',
       LOCAL_SERVER: 'localhost:5000',
       CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS: 15000,
       PRODUCTION_FIRST: true,
       // ...
     }
     ```
   - The client detects `ENABLED: false` and skips multiplayer server discovery.

2. **Shared Render multiplayer server**
   - Use the default public server at `bgs-mp.onrender.com`.
   - This is the same behavior used by the Babylon playground exports in this repo.
   - No additional build-time configuration is required if `CONFIG.MULTIPLAYER.PRODUCTION_SERVER` remains set to `bgs-mp.onrender.com`.

3. **Custom multiplayer server**
   - Point the client at your own multiplayer host.
   - Set the Vite build-time environment variable `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_HOST` in Netlify site settings.
   - Example values:
     - `my-mp.onrender.com`
     - `myserver.example.com:5000`
     - `https://myserver.example.com`
   - The client strips the scheme automatically and uses only the host portion.

## Netlify configuration

### Step 1: Set deployment settings

In `src/deployment/settings/settings.mjs`, configure the deployment for Netlify static hosting.

Example:

```js
const deploymentSettings = {
  host: 'netlify',
  type: 'static',
  services: [],
  static: {
    basePath: '/'
  }
};

export default deploymentSettings;
```

- `host: 'netlify'` and `type: 'static'` are required.
- `services` can be an empty array because Netlify will only host the client assets.
- `basePath` controls the deployed base URL if you publish to a subpath; `/` is the default.

### Step 2: Prepare deployment artifacts

Run:

```bash
npm run deploy:prepare
```

This script validates the deployment settings and generates the Netlify host files (for example `netlify.toml`).

### Step 3: Build the static site

Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces the static assets under `dist/`.

### Step 4: Configure Netlify environment variables

In your Netlify site settings, add the environment variables:

- `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_HOST` — optional, set only when using a custom multiplayer server
- `NODE_ENV=production` — optional, but recommended for production builds

If you want to disable multiplayer entirely, do not set `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_HOST`; instead use `CONFIG.MULTIPLAYER.ENABLED = false`.

### Step 5: Deploy

Deploy the generated site through Netlify as usual:

- Connect your Git repository in the Netlify dashboard
- Set the build command to `npm run build`
- Set the publish directory to `dist`
- Add the `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_HOST` environment variable if needed

## Multiplayer behavior details

### Using the shared default server

- The built client will probe `https://bgs-mp.onrender.com/api/multiplayer/health`.
- If the health check succeeds, it will connect to `https://bgs-mp.onrender.com/api/multiplayer/stream`.
- This server is shared and suitable for demos, but not for production-grade or large-class deployments.

### Using a custom server

- Set `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_HOST` in Netlify site environment variables.
- The client will validate the host with a health check before using it.
- If the health probe fails, the client throws a clear error instead of silently falling back.
- The custom server must allow CORS from the deployed front-end origin if the server is on a different domain.

### Disabling multiplayer

- Set `CONFIG.MULTIPLAYER.ENABLED = false` in `src/client/config/game_config.ts`.
- The client gracefully carries on without any backend multiplayer server.
- This is the recommended mode for a purely static Netlify deployment that does not require remote multiplayer.

## Notes for Netlify static sites

- Netlify cannot host the Go multiplayer server for this repo as a backend service in a static site deployment.
- If you require a live multiplayer server, use a remote host such as `bgs-mp.onrender.com` or your own server.
- Use `?mp=<host>` or `#mp=<host>` URL overrides only for exported playground snippets and runtime steering; Netlify builds still respect the environment-set `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_HOST` before defaulting to `bgs-mp.onrender.com`.

## Troubleshooting

- If the site loads but multiplayer fails, open the browser console and confirm the client is probing the expected host.
- If using a custom host, confirm the server responds to `/api/multiplayer/health` and that CORS allows the site origin.
- If multiplayer should be disabled, verify `CONFIG.MULTIPLAYER.ENABLED` is `false` and not overwritten by another build-time setting.
